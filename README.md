# Self Delusion

This notebook replicates the results of the paper [Shaking the foundations: delusions in sequence models for interaction and control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10819.pdf).


## Assumptions (see Remark 11 in paper)
The paper assumes a [multi-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) environment. The bandit has 5 arms and the best arm is `l=1`. The expert interacts with the bandit using the following policy:
``` Python
action_probs = [0.6, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]
```

Based on the expert action the environment returns a reward (observation):
``` Python
if action == latent:
    observation_probs = [0.25, 0.75]
else:
    observation_probs = [0.75, 0.25]
```

Depending on whether the environment configuration (best arm) can be observed, two cases can be distinguished:
* Fully observable: Environment configuration `l` is observable
* Partially observable: Environment configuration `l` is not observable.
We assume that we cannot observe the environment configuration `l` when training the model.

## Model
A model is trained based on the interactions between the expert and the environment (5-armed bandit). This model is then used to interact with the environment.

Model fully observable
```
P(l,a1,o1,a2,o2,a3) = P(a3|a1,o1,a2,o2) * P(a2,o2|a1,o1) * P(a1,o1|l) * P(l)
```

Model partially observable
```
P(a1,o1,a2,o2,a3) = P(a3|a1,o1,a2,o2) * P(a2,o2|a1,o1) * P(a1,o1)
```


```python
from model import Model

# (a1,o1) = (1,1)
# (a2,o2) = (2,0)
model: Model = Model()
action_probs = model.predict(past_interactions=[(1,1), (2,0)])
print("P(a3|a1,o1,a2,o2) =", action_probs)

# Probability of action being 1
print("P(a3=1|a1,o1,a2,o2) =", action_probs[0])
```

    P(a3|a1,o1,a2,o2) = [0.491304347826087, 0.14347826086956525, 0.12173913043478261, 0.12173913043478261, 0.12173913043478261]
    P(a3=1|a1,o1,a2,o2) = 0.491304347826087



```python
import random
import config

SEQ_LENGTH: int = 20

def run_agent(latent: int, seed: int):
    if seed is not None:
        random.seed(seed)
    condition: list = []
    actions: list = []
    model = Model()
    for _ in range(0, SEQ_LENGTH):
        probs = model.predict(condition)
        action = random.choices(config.ACTION_SPACE, weights=probs, k=1)[0]
        actions.append(action)
        probs = config.prob_observation(latent, action)
        observation = random.choices(config.OBSERVATION_SPACE, weights=probs, k=1)[0]
        condition += [(action, observation)]
    return actions


print("Actions generated by the model over 20 interactions:")
for index in range(3):
    actions = run_agent(1, index)
    action_groups = [actions[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(actions), 5)]
    text = f"Example {index + 1} – actions: "
    for action_group in action_groups:
        text += " ".join([str(x) for x in action_group]) + "  "

    print(text)
```

    Actions generated by the model over 20 interactions:
    Example 1 – actions: 5 4 5 5 5  5 3 5 5 5  4 5 5 5 5  5 3 5 5 5  
    Example 2 – actions: 1 4 2 3 1  4 4 2 1 5  1 5 1 1 1  1 1 1 4 2  
    Example 3 – actions: 5 1 5 5 5  5 5 5 5 5  1 5 4 5 3  4 5 5 5 5
